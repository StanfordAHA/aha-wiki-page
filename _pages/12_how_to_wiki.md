<b>HOW TO WIKI</b> using Github Pages

Everyone please contribute! Here's how:

* clone or visit the `aha-wiki-page` repo
  [https://github.StanfordAHA.com/aha-wiki-page](https://github.StanfordAHA.com/aha-wiki-page)


* edit wiki page in subdirectory `_pages`

* wiki pages ordered according to filename; currently this is
  enforced by preceding each filename with a two-digit number that
  preserves its order in the wiki nav bar (is this sustainable?)

* each page has a little `title/author/date/layout` header, look at
  existing pages for guidance

* AFAICT you don't get to preview the page until you have pushed your
  changes to the repo master (PLEASE if someone knows differently, let
  me know and/or edit this page to show how). And/or you can maybe
  preview locally using the command `retext --preview <filename>`

* new wiki pages show up here:
