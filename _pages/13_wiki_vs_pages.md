Currently we use Github Pages to implement our Aha wiki. But what if
we used the native Github Wiki mechanism instead? Below are some of
the tradeoffs, as I see them. Also, I have prepared prototypes so you
can compare our docs as
* [wiki version](https://github.com/StanfordAHA/aha/wiki) or
* pages version
[(source files)](https://github.com/StanfordAHA/aha-wiki-page)
[(rendered pages)](https://stanfordaha.github.io/aha-wiki-page).

You can see the tradeoffs discussion here:
